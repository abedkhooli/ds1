# Data Science Fundamentals: Training Resources
* General Notes
 * This site provides __additional resources__ for the Data Science Fundamentals training course. Trainer's notes are available at the [Trainer's Git Repository](https://github.com/Abdel-Razzak/Data-Science-Fundamentals). Note: [updated trainer's notes with navigation](https://github.com/Abdel-Razzak/DSF). To stay up to date, you can follow hashtags like [#DataScience]( https://twitter.com/search?q=%23DataScience) on Twitter.
 * If a file does not open in the interface, use the __View Raw__ or __download__ links. Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files), can be opened with the [nbviewer] (https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) if they fail to open directly from Github.

Data from [Amazon reviews](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/). Data from [Expedia](https://www.programmableweb.com/api/expedia). Data from PEX: [historical](https://www.pex.ps/PSEWEBSITE/English/ListedCompanies.aspx?Tabindex=1). Telecom data: [Italy data](http://aris.me/contents/teaching/data-mining-2015/project/BigDataChallengeData.html). Retail data: [Belgium Grovery shopping](http://recsyswiki.com/wiki/Grocery_shopping_datasets) and [Walmart](https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting/data). Social media data: [Twitter](https://apps.twitter.com/) which requires an account and app creation (use the tweepy package) and [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api). Images: [Image-net](http://www.image-net.org/). Research articles and datasets from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/). Do not forget local and internal data: data from your organization/institution can be anonymized and used, your local supermarket, utility provider (water or electricity), mobile operator, municipal fees and services, ... etc.
 
* Useful Resources
 * Python and Jupyter: [Anaconda distribution download](https://www.continuum.io/downloads),  [IPython Notebook Tutorial (Jupyter)](https://plot.ly/python/ipython-notebook-tutorial/), [Change Jupyter Home directory](https://wolfscie.wordpress.com/2016/04/01/home-directory-in-jupyter/), [Python basics course 1: edX](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-python-data-science-microsoft-dat208x-3), [Python basics course 2: Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-analysis/), A [Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython). Here's some [markdown help](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). To get your working directory (where your notebook is), use %ls in a code cell and %lsmagic to get all similar commands. See [more magic commands] (https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/interactive/magics.html) help. Append ? to a method to get help. For a list of installed packages, use __conda list__ and __pip freeze__ (take the union of the two lists). See also [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) for both code examples and datasets. A list of [Python packages](https://pypi.python.org/pypi) has many useful tools. For more help on Jupyter notebooks, see [28 Jupyter Notebook tips, tricks and shortcuts](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tips-tricks-shortcuts/). Here's also a [video tutorial on Jupyter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW29067qVWk).
 * Statistical Foundations: [Statistical Thinking for Data Science and Analytics](https://www.edx.org/course/statistical-thinking-data-science-columbiax-ds101x-0). See also [Empirical CDF](https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat464/node/84). A list of [Common Probability Distributions](http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2015/12/common-probability-distributions-the-data-scientists-crib-sheet/) is also available. See also: [A Refresher on Statistical Significance](https://hbr.org/2016/02/a-refresher-on-statistical-significance). There are two books for in-depth knowledge: [The Elements of Statistical Learning:Data Mining, Inference,  and Prediction](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/) and [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) with examples in R.
 * Mathematical Foundations: [Math for Data Science: Self Starter](https://elitedatascience.com/learn-math-for-data-science), [Essence of Linear Algebra](http://www.3blue1brown.com/essence-of-linear-algebra/), [Calculus for Deep Learning](http://wiki.fast.ai/index.php/Calculus_for_Deep_Learning). Most of this material is relevant for both this course and next one.
 * Two helpful introductory courses: [Foundations of Data Science](https://data-8.appspot.com/sp16/course) from Berkeley and [CS 109 Data Science](http://cs109.github.io/2015/) from Harvard.
 * Data Science Ethics: you can take [this free edX MOOC](https://www.edx.org/course/data-science-ethics-michiganx-ds101x-1) from the University of Michigan (but apply local context to raised issues).
* Projects and Homeworks
 * Please create a GitHub account (if you haven't already) and upload your own work on homeworks using a friendly structure/navigation. Your notebooks must be readable (markdown cells and code comments).
 * Please provide a project proposal (one page) by February 18, 2017 (one per group). State the problem, data source(s), expected output and list group members. Projects will be presented in a special session one week from the last session.
* Sessions 7 and 8, project presentations
 * Session 7 will be March 1st (Wednesday) at 4:00 PM and session 8 on Saturday March 4th at __8:00 AM__.
 * __Project presentations__: March 18th.
* __Applied Data Science (next course)__
 * All trainees who complete this course and present their projects are allowed to enroll
 * Other candidates must demonstrate equivalent knowledge and skills through an assessment
 * More information about next course (part 2) in the [Applied Data Science](../../../ds2/) section.
