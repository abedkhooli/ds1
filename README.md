# Data Science Fundamentals: Training Resources
* General Notes
 * This site provides __additional resources__ for the Data Science Fundamentals training course. Trainer's notes are available at the [Trainer's Git Repository](https://github.com/Abdel-Razzak/Data-Science-Fundamentals). Note: [updated trainer's notes with navigation](https://github.com/Abdel-Razzak/DSF). To stay up to date, you can follow hashtags like [#DataScience]( https://twitter.com/search?q=%23DataScience) on Twitter.
 * If a file does not open in the interface, use the __View Raw__ or __download__ links. Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files), can be opened with the [nbviewer] (https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) if they fail to open directly from Github.

* Datasets
 * Environmental data: [Air Quality in Ramallah Area](data/)
 * More datasets can be found at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), [UCI Machine learning datasets](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html), [data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset), [OECD](https://data.oecd.org/), [WorldBank](http://data.worldbank.org/), [EU data portal](https://www.europeandataportal.eu/), [DataHub](https://datahub.io/dataset) and [Awesome public datasets](https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets) - to name just a few. 
 Also: Traffic data - [Google](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/layer-traffic) with [note](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4600656/access-googles-traffic-data-through-a-web-service) and [Bing](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh441725). Data from [Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) and Uber: [data sample](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/uber-tlc-foil-response). [Uber Movement](https://movement.uber.com/cities) is for city officials only at this time. Data from Yelp: [Challenge with financial rewards](https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge) and [academic datasets](https://github.com/Yelp/dataset-examples). Data from [Amazon reviews](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/). Data from [Expedia](https://www.programmableweb.com/api/expedia). Data from PEX: [historical](https://www.pex.ps/PSEWEBSITE/English/ListedCompanies.aspx?Tabindex=1). Telecom data: [Italy data](http://aris.me/contents/teaching/data-mining-2015/project/BigDataChallengeData.html). Retail data: [Belgium Grovery shopping](http://recsyswiki.com/wiki/Grocery_shopping_datasets) and [Walmart](https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting/data). Do not forget local and internal data: data from your organization/institution can be anonymized and used, your local supermarket, utility provider (water or electricity), mobile operator, municipal fees and services, ... etc.
 
* Useful Resources
 * Python and Jupyter: [Anaconda distribution download](https://www.continuum.io/downloads),  [IPython Notebook Tutorial (Jupyter)](https://plot.ly/python/ipython-notebook-tutorial/), [Change Jupyter Home directory](https://wolfscie.wordpress.com/2016/04/01/home-directory-in-jupyter/), [Python basics course 1: edX](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-python-data-science-microsoft-dat208x-3), [Python basics course 2: Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-analysis/), A [Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython). Here's some [markdown help](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). To get your working directory (where your notebook is), use %ls in a code cell and %lsmagic to get all similar commands. See [more magic commands] (https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/interactive/magics.html) help. Append ? to a method to get help. For a list of installed packages, use __conda list__ and __pip freeze__ (take the union of the two lists). See also [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) for both code examples and datasets.
 * Statistical Foundations: [Statistical Thinking for Data Science and Analytics](https://www.edx.org/course/statistical-thinking-data-science-columbiax-ds101x-0). See also [Empirical CDF](https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat464/node/84). A list of [Common Probability Distributions](http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2015/12/common-probability-distributions-the-data-scientists-crib-sheet/) is also available. See also: [A Refresher on Statistical Significance](https://hbr.org/2016/02/a-refresher-on-statistical-significance)
 * Mathematical Foundations: [Math for Data Science: Self Starter](https://elitedatascience.com/learn-math-for-data-science), [Essence of Linear Algebra](http://www.3blue1brown.com/essence-of-linear-algebra/), [Calculus for Deep Learning](http://wiki.fast.ai/index.php/Calculus_for_Deep_Learning). Most of this material is relevant for both this course and next one.
* Projects and Homeworks
 * Please create a GitHub account (if you haven't already) and upload your own work on homeworks using a friendly structure/navigation. Your notebooks must be readable (markdown cells and code comments).
 * Please provide a project proposal (one page) by February 18, 2017 (one per group). State the problem, data source(s), expected output and list group members. Projects will be presented in a special session one week from the last session.
