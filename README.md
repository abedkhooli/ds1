# Data Science Fundamentals: Training Resources
* General Notes
 * This site provides __additional resources__ for the Data Science Fundamentals training course. Trainer's notes are available at the [Trainer's Git Repository](https://github.com/Abdel-Razzak/Data-Science-Fundamentals). To stay up to date, you can follow hashtags like [#DataScience]( https://twitter.com/search?q=%23DataScience) on Twitter.
 * If a file does not open in the interface, use the __View Raw__ or __download__ links. Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files), can be opened with the [nbviewer] (https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) if they fail to open directly from Github.

 * This file provides access to the important resources in this site. It will be updated regularly. You can ignore other files listed above (some are tests and may not work)
* Datasets
 * Environmental data: [NO2 and CO concentrations in Ramallah](data/)
 * More datasets can be found at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), [UCI Machine learning datasets](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html) and [Awesome public datasets](https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets) - to name just a few.
 
* Useful Resources
 * Python and Jupyter: [Anaconda distribution download](https://www.continuum.io/downloads),  [IPython Notebook Tutorial (Jupyter)](https://plot.ly/python/ipython-notebook-tutorial/), [Python basics course 1: edX]((https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-python-data-science-microsoft-dat208x-3), [Python basics course 2: Coursera]( https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-analysis/), A [Whirlwind Tour of Python]( https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython). See also [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) for both code examples and datasets.
 * Statistical Foundations: [Statistical Thinking for Data Science and Analytics](https://www.edx.org/course/statistical-thinking-data-science-columbiax-ds101x-0)
 * Mathematical Foundations: [Essence of Linear Algebra](http://www.3blue1brown.com/essence-of-linear-algebra/), [Calculus for Deep Learning](http://wiki.fast.ai/index.php/Calculus_for_Deep_Learning). Most of this material is relevant for both this course and next one.
