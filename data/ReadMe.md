# Sensor air quality data from Palestine
* Notes
 * The files listed here are air quality data from sensors collecting either NO2 and CO or particulate matter (PM25) in addition to temperature and relative humidity. 
 * Devices are located indoors with limited indirect exposure to ambient atmosphere.
 * The significant colums are time stamp, temperature [deg C], relative humidity [%] and either PM25 [micro gram/m3] or NO2 [parts per billion or ppb] and CO [parts per million or ppm]. 
 * Data in csv format (after decompression) provided under the __Creative Commons Non Commercial License__: [CC BY-NC 4.0] (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)
 * We will try to provide additional sensor data and increment available datasets but there is no guarantee this will happen 
 * In case data has discontinuity, this is mostly due to power outage
 * The PM25 sensors reading frequency is once every 60 seconds, the NO2/CO units every 30 seconds
 * Data is provided as is and may not be suitable for scientific research
